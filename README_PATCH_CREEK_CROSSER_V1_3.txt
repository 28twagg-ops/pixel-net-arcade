PATCH v1.3 (canon wrapper restore)

What this patch DOES:
- Adds Creek Crosser to the library (games.json)
- Adds thumbnail
- Adds a NEW wrapper at PIXEL-NET/games/creek-crosser/index.html that matches the Millipede "golden" autoscaling layout

What this patch CANNOT do yet:
- Ship the full Creek Crosser game.html, because the previous patch accidentally contained a truncated placeholder.
  You must replace PIXEL-NET/games/creek-crosser/game.html with your full Creek Crosser HTML file.

After you paste the real game.html, the wrapper will autoscale like Millipede and the game will display its own colors/UI.
